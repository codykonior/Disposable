SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Dispose disposable variables, the equivalent of C# using for PowerShell.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Objects which own unmanaged resources (such as network connections and SQL Server 
    database connections) should have their Dispose method called in order to free up 
    those connections and so the object's memory can later be released in a timely manner.

    New-DisposableObject provides a simple way of managing this using a simple syntax 
    usually consisting of the instantiation of the object followed by a scriptblock in 
    which it will be used, before being disposed of behind the scenes.

REQUIREMENTS
    
EXAMPLE #1
    New-DisposableObject ($dataSet = New-Object System.Data.DataSet) {
    }
